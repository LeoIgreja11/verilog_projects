This repository contains an open-source implementation of a **BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) to 7-Segment Decoder**, including digital logic design, Verilog code, simulation, waveform analysis, and layout synthesis.

## üîß Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **/digital/**: Logic gate schematic designed in [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)
- **/verilog/**: RTL implementation in Verilog and testbench
- **/sim/**: Icarus Verilog simulations and GTKWave waveform files
- **/layout/**: OpenLane flow for synthesis and layout generation


## üì∑ Schematic

The image below shows the logic gate-level schematic of the BCD to 7-Segment Decoder, designed using the [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) software.  
It represents how each segment of the display is driven based on the 4-bit BCD input.

## üåä Wave Forms

The image below shows monitors the waveforms of both input and output signals of the BCD to 7-Segment Decoder, using serial pulse inputs. The waveform visualization is done through the GTKWave software, allowing detailed observation of how the Decoder responds to changes in the 4-bit BCD input.
